## Overview

Make your geospatial data come to life with R. This course will get you quickly up and running with the new R workflow for geospatial data. An explosion of packages for working with spatial data means you can ditch your GIS software and do geospatial analysis in R end-to-end. You will learn to read, manipulate and visualize spatial data and you'll be introduced to functionality that will have you saying "I didn't know you could do that in R!". In addition to learning from Zev Ross, you will benefit from support during the workshop from two additional spatial analysis experts, Angela Li from the Center for Spatial Data Science and Hollie Olmstead from ZevRoss Spatial Analysis, each with extensive experience analyzing spatial data and teaching core concepts. During the workshop, you will learn: 

* Key strategies for getting spatial data into R. This includes an introduction to powerful packages for accessing data on census, climate, land cover and more— as well as functionality for reading external files (e.g., shapefiles, geojson, geopackages, grids and tiffs). 
* The latest innovations in spatial data visualization. Participants will create both static and interactive visualizations using the flexible and feature-rich {tmap} and {mapview} as well as explore the landscape of specialized visualization packages such as {cartography}, {geogrid}, {rayshader} and {concaveman}. 
* How spatial data can be integrated into data science workflows, how to manipulate, slice and dice and make sense of spatial data.You will also learn key geoprocessing techniques for both vector and raster data including buffering, clipping, masking, cropping, computing distance and others.
